# Hello, I'm Drucilla ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ—£ Passionate about IT since I was a little girl, I'm a full stack developer based in Nantes, France. Two years' experience at Accenture enabled me to build up my skills in web development in general. I'm currently specializing in front-end web application development.

## Soft skills
- Curiosity: When I got my first computer, I wondered. How does this machine manage to process so much information in so little time?
- Team spirit: When someone is faced with a problem, I don't hesitate to help them find a solution together.
- Initiative: If the existing tool doesn't meet a specific need, I suggest an alternative solution.

## Interests
Music, Sport, Reading Webtoons
